# Machine Learning for Life Sciences  

In this page, I will be collecting information on ML for Biology, Medicine, Pharmacology etc. Applications, libraries, presentations, knowledge and technology that contribute to advancing Life Sciences.  
[Peter Norvig](https://youtu.be/hVW1mwLtDcI?t=890) mentioned that had he been starting his career now, he'd like to "_[...] understand biology better, there is a lot of opportunity there, a lot of data, it's important. All aspects of health are important_."

## Presentations  
- At [NeurIPS2019](https://neurips.cc), a workshop on [ML4H: Machine Learning for Health](https://ml4health.github.io/2019/pages/schedule.html) took place. A conference attendee wrote a useful and extensive post [summarising this workshop](https://willieboag.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/ml4h-2019-machine-learning-for-health/).  
- The [Scripps Research Translational Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/index.html) has uploaded presentations on the Future of Individualised Medicine (playlists for the [2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoh75bAP4Qoh_DKJGrWudy9GNTNEzyXvG) and [2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoh75bAP4Qog_EQqynBixihxtsXCe6B72) talks). A talk I found interesting was by [Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiLPUkpH6Kg), presenting an interesting viewpoint on personalised medicine.  

## Software
- [mediKanren](https://github.com/webyrd/mediKanren) Proof-of-concept for reasoning over the SemMedDB knowledge base, using miniKanren + heuristics + indexing.  
- [NLP Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University code repo](https://github.com/NLPatVCU)  

## Datasets 
- [PhysioNet Databases](https://physionet.org/about/database/)
