# AI for applications

Machine Learning (ML) applications have taken off rapidly in the last decade, with the advent of more powerful processing units and humans generating data in abundance. While the term can be overused occasionally, this technology serves as a powerful set of tools that can augment human activities. Since it has become pervasive in science and technology, and recognising its usefulness when utilised for a good cause, I will allocate some time to study it from well established resources. I will attempt to treat this learning challenge in a somewhat parallel fashion. Namely, I will be revising and expanding my linear algebra knowledge, while slowly working my way through both academic and application-oriented ML courses. Setting manageable bite-sized goals, like [experienced leaders](https://youtu.be/doLMhcaDWUc?t=3027) advise, will help me improve my knowledge and skills in the area of ML.  
 
## Courses including video lectures  

 Mathematically speaking, Machine and Deep Learning make extensive use of the [global common language](https://youtu.be/qkzkOQiSuG4?t=635) of Linear Algebra. For those who want to revise or learn the subject more in depth,  a few noteworthy references (in my opinion) are found below.  

 * Key ideas on the relation between two functions is found in [Highlights of Calculus (approx. 10 hours)](http://ocw.mit.edu/highlights-of-calculus).  
 * Bringing it back to basics, a refresher through [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (12 hours)](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-0002F16) can be useful.  
 * A great succinct visual and intuitive overview of Linear Algebra, comes from [Essence of Linear Algebra (approx. 3 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).  
 * Another excellent, more detailed resource is an MIT OpenCourseWare course on [Differential Equations and Linear Algebra (16.5 hours)](http://ocw.mit.edu/RES-18-009F15).  
 * [A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/) contains ideas and suggestions from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra.
 * Should one want to study an undergraduate-level Linear Algebra course, they can look into [MIT 18.065 (28 hours)](https://ocw.mit.edu/18-065S18). 
 * Online courses and educational material about complexity science, can be found at [Complexity Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/user/ComplexityExplorer).

 * A well known academic ML course focusing on the theoretical aspect, that has attracted a lot of attention is [CS229: Machine Learning (approx. 26.5 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU), accompanied by excellent resources in the [class website](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) including very helpful [CS229 Machine Learning cheat sheets](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/).  
 * Another excellent course and more application-oriented is [CS230: Deep Learning (approx. 12.5 hours)](http://cs230.stanford.edu). Keeping an offline copy of material can be done through the Terminal   
```bash
$ wget -r -np -nH http://cs230.stanford.edu/files
```  
([reference](https://bmwieczorek.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/wget-recursively-download-all-files-from-certain-directory-listed-by-apache/)). 

 * For a more in-depth understanding of Deep Learning, [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (19.5 hours)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) emphasises visual recognition. This course also offers a great set of [class notes](https://cs231n.github.io/). See also [How do Convolutional Neural Networks work?](https://brohrer.github.io/how_convolutional_neural_networks_work.html).   
 * Further to understanding Neural Networks, we can look into applying them on Natural Language Processing with Stanford's [CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (approx. 25.5 hours)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), complemented by [CS224U: Natural Language Understanding](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/).  
 * An excellent Reinforcement Learning course is [CS234: Reinforcement Learning Winter 2019](http://cs234.stanford.edu/).  
 * For those who are less inclined to study academic lectures or more eager to delve into the practical side right away, an application-oriented course which can be studied on its own or in addition with material mentioned above, is Fast.ai's [Introduction to Machine Learning (approx. 19 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdWqFTmn0Y&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSyktd8A_x0JNd6lxDcZE96) and [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3 (approx. 14 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSIJb-Qd3pw0cqCbkGeS0xn).  
 * Fast.ai Deep Learning courses are complemented really nicely with Coursera's [deeplearning.ai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w) material. In this playlist, you can find a number of courses, condensing quite nicely main Deep Learning principles.

 * As a side note, [CS107: Programming paradigms (22.5 hrs)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS107) can complement someone's software engineering skills, writing more efficient and well structured code.  
 * [Research Software Engineering with Python](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/) is a course that moves beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment.  
 * [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa11/) concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem instead of focusing on low-level computer hardware operations. This course is based on its namesake seminal book [SICP][sicp].  
 * [Pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes) contains Python programs, usually short, for perfecting programming skills.  
 * [Programming for the Puzzled (8 hrs)](https://ocw.mit.edu/6-S095IAP18) builds a bridge between the recreational world of algorithmic puzzles and the pragmatic world of computer programming, teaching students to program while solving puzzles.
 * [Steven Skiena's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/StevenSkiena) contains a wealth of information on AI, including lectures from classes Prof Skiena has taught such as Analysis of Algorithms, Data Science and Computational Biology.
