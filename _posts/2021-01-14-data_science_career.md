*TL;DR*  
1. The Job Description Correctly Uses Data Science Terminology   
2. A Hands-on Test Is Part of the Hiring Process ([The Three Kinds Of Data Science Project Exams That Show Up In A Data Science Interview](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/articles/the-three-kinds-of-data-science-project-exams-that-show-up-in-a-data-science-interview))  
3. There Are Concrete Details Instead of Repetitive Buzzwords ([Telling Truth from Hype When Hunting for Data Science Work](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2018/11/telling-truth-from-hype-when-hunting-for-data-science-work/))  
4. The Company Is Open to You Finishing Current Obligations Before Starting  
5. The Company Mentions a Data Science Team  
6. The Company Is Well-Reviewed (Review sites to check include   [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/companies), [Vault](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for), [JobAdvisor](https://www.thejobcrowd.com/))

## Useful advice  
- [Leadership advice, Sebastian Thrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4VOgCId-xw)   
- A [DataCamp educator said](https://twitter.com/hugobowne/status/1209300906828795904) "[...] _I say jump into data sets that interest you, discover things, put on GitHub, write a blog. [...]_".  
- An [autodidact ML researcher](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner) gave some ideas on building an ML portfolio   
"Good ideas come from ML sources that are a bit quirky.
    - NeurIPS from 1987 - 1997
    - Stanford’s CS224n & CS231n projects
    - Twitter likes from ML outliers
    - ML Reddit’s WAYR
    - Kaggle Kernels
    - Top 15-40% papers on Arxiv Sanity"  

- [An interesting point](https://twitter.com/iamtrask/status/1224396268102934529) about landing a job in an area of interest "_Put another way - the best way to get a job doing X is to *start*
doing it *now* for free! It shows that you're *actually* that interested,
while simultaneously proving that your *actually* competent. The easiest
person for me to hire is someone who is already doing the job"._ In other words, show initiative, interest and skills in practice.  

- [How to begin data science projects](https://medium.com/@turinghut23/how-to-begin-data-science-projects-a8d88f998e8a) What to do when you don’t know what to do.  

**Importantly**, keep sharpening and refining your understanding of [ethically applying AI](https://www.fast.ai/topics/#ai-in-society)  .  There is even a related conference on [Fairness, Accountability and Transparency](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs16j6ot-CYq-ZqYpO-vqMg).  

[KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) contains an interesting list of thoughts, information, news and references to  AI, Analytics, Big Data, Data Mining, Data Science, and Machine Learning.  

A nice set of principles (taken from an ARM® job advertisement):
> Be quirky not egocentric.  
  Recognize the power in saying ‘I don’t know’.  
  Make trust our default position.  
  Hold strong opinions lightly.  
  
Similarly, a good point (the keywords here are "_humble_" and "_friendly_") found in another company's job description is:   
> [...] Work alongside smart, humble and friendly people on real projects.   

Another nice headline of a recent job opening, reads: 
> come for the language, stay for the culture

Aiming at attracting talent based on a specific technology stack, while advertising the company culture as a valid reason to stay.   

[Andrew Ng's general advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI) is simple and sensible but not necessarily easy to achieve:  

> Try to choose the things to work on that allow you to  
	- Learn the most  
	- Do important work (that matters)
