# Moving from Python to Julia

**TL;DR**: [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is an upcoming general-purpose programming language that is designed to be fast, dynamic, reproducible and composable. It has caught the attention of prominent figures in the Machine Learning community[^1][^2]. While not as popular as Python yet, I'm investing time and effort to learn it and use it as my main language.  



[^1]: [Peter Norvig](https://www.norvig.com/), the Director of Research at Google [recently said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVW1mwLtDcI&t=2323s) "_I'd be happier if Julia was the main choice, since Python has some limitations. Python is starting to have some type declarations now,  but they are not taking them seriously. Julia does a much better job at that. And Julia was written to be more efficient from the start. So I think that's probably a better choice. [...] I think that the popularity is going to be more important than the difference between them [languages]._"  
[^2]: [Jeremy Howard](https://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy), who teaches Machine Learning using a code-first top-down approach at fast.ai was asked [during an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2V2kf2gNnI&t=2400s) if he expects to write the fast.ai library in a new language, moving away from Python. He replied "_[...] Python is not the future of Machine Learning, it can't be. It's so nicely hackable but it's so frustrating to work with a language where you can't do anything fast enough unless you call out to some external CUDA or C code. And you can't run anything in parallel unless you put on another whole process. I find that working with Python is so much overhead in my brain, to try to get it to work fast enough. I really hope that Julia is really successful, because it's a language with a nicely designed type system and a nicely designed dispatch system. And most importantly it's kind of Julia all the way down [...] until you hit the LLVM._"
