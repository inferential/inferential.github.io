# About

Hi, I'm Eirini üò∑ (do wear a DIY face mask -> [#Masks4All](https://masks4all.co/)). An ardent supporter of learning by doing and appreciative of reaching conclusions based on evidence and valid objective arguments. The person behind the YouTube channel [Applied Science](https://youtu.be/ihbYtxaEDSk?t=105) makes a good point, that University does not fully prepare someone for applying knowledge in real cases (see also [Falsehoods CS Students (Still) Believe Upon Graduating](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/cs-falsehoods.html)). This is my attempt at improving my skills, with practical problem solving in mind. Hopefully it'll also help the occasional reader to learn something new. Thanks for visiting :)
